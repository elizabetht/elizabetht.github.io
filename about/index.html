  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>A little something about me. Born in Kerala and brought up in TamilNadu, I have the cultural mix of both the states of India running through my blood and my brains. A school topper all throughout, I graduated from one of the prestigious Engineering Institution in TamilNadu, India in the city of Coimbatore. As fate would have it, I landed up in the deemed Software Industry eight years ago and still continuing with the course of meal. A passionate Java/JSP/Cloud/CI/C++ software consultant, an avid learner, a technology enthusiast and a beginner runner sums me up!</p>
